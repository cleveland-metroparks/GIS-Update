### P&D
- Facilities DB: Zoo assessments have started, light support needed to date - SAME
- Scheduling a time to go out to Big Met to map out the pin curbs along the cart path. I'll also check path widths and make sure the alignment we have is accurate.

### Legal

- Bradley Woods parcel/deed boundaries sent to Stephanie for review along with spreadsheet of properties within the carbon credit project area: COMPLETE
- Land Protection GIS page: still need to migrate contours, link highway shields

### App
- Ongoing trail/network updates, need to push an update to production server for routing network (primarily to add West Creek mountain bike trail w/the loops builder)
- Created and uploaded new points dataset so all Attractions/location icons have information for click-events built into MapBox: not tested by Jeff yet
- App interviews complete

### ADA

### Outside request
- ODNR is using our trails data in a portal they are developing for the public to locate trails throughout the state. I'm going to translate our data as best as possible into ODNR format to ensure CM trails are represented as accurately as possible.
