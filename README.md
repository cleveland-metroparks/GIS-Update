## Tom
### Facilities DB
- Sent info to Zoo staff to review for Fulcrum App considerations (i.e. review domain values for various categories): no feedback yet

### Legal
- All layers specific to Land Protection page have been loaded and styled on new page

### App
- Going to be reviewing format for trail segments used for routing by trails in the app

### ADA
- All ADA updates have been appended to the transition plan spreadsheet to track what's been completed to date. Now I'm working through populating a column that tracks what is left to do at each facility.

### Misc GIS
- Data migration to new server: noticed a lot of source data formats (for base layers) that have changed which makes updating more painful. I'm going to concentrate more on porting over whats currently in place and make incremental updates in between other initiatives.

## Brandon

### CHEERS
- Working with the contractors from the CHEERS grant to provide data that is needed.

### Hawthorn Valley
- Create a video from existing drone footage to show the overall property, highlight specific areas to show their importance.

### 3D Modeling
- Look about Lodge

## India

## Stephen

### Infrastructure
* Update servers for vulnerability scan ongoing
* Porting over datasets for display on new print server

* RE360 Camera project with Case Students nearing completion. Started testing with data processing
* Deploying plant disease app in conjunction with Kent State

### 3D Models  
* New 360 model Zoo entrance
* 3D model of orang exhibit

### Funding opportunities
* ~$50,000 in funding from World Bank Tanzania as extension to work in Zanzibar, unknown timeline, pro-forma invoice
* Possible project of unknown size opening up in northern Tanzania
* European Space Agency has a call for proposals for a fund to provide _Planet_ data. It may be an opportunity to get data for the Andean Bear Conservation Alliance. Current projections on data costs for that project are infeasible at ~$900k.

## Upcoming Travel and Presentations
* _Open source data processing with OpenDroneMap_ presented by Corey Snipes, one of our newer, local OpenDroneMap contributors will take place remotely at the 3-day DroneCamp short course on drone, June 23-25
* World Bank meeting originally scheduled for May now moved to November
