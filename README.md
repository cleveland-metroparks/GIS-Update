## Tom
### P&D
- ADA Transition Plan: all updates have been compiled into a single spreadsheet. The master spreadsheet still needs to be corrected (phase column was out of sorts) and stripped of formulas.
- BUILD Grant application: reviewed template cost-benefit analysis and prepping data in small section of Geauga County that would fall within the 1.5 mi buffer.
- Gas Wells: to date, incomplete findings from the documents . Need to pull the physical map book from Isaac's old office to see if that clears things up.
- Facilities DB: Zoo has been on hold.

### Development
- Bike/Walkshed analysis around Padua-Parmadale Properties, confirmed suspicion of lower poverty rates

### Marketing
- Updated Activity info sent for North Chagrin and Bedford Reservations: Linsey asked for GPS coordinates on a couple locations

### App
- Keeping eye on road closures

### Real Estate
- Prioritizing porting over data to new server so new secure connection can be in place for next meeting

### Misc GIS
- ODNR trails inventory: sent Tom Arbour the data as we have it but also reviewed his metadata and GDB templates. Format calls for formal inventory of trail names with descriptions and trailheads with various amenities coded. The former would be a good initiative to work with OE staff on making sure we have novel descriptions for trails across the park.
- RTA-Park Access analysis on hold, meeting with Angelo pushed back to June maybe. ITS did provide me with a way to export all programs with details like date/time which we plan to use in the analysis.
- Data migration to new server (maybe 60% complete)

## Brandon
### BUILD Grant
- Continue rebuilding the overall map project
- Update Chagrin Valley Connector alignment
- Work with Sara to develop maps for grant application

### Hawthorn Valley
- Develop maps/graphics
- Create a video from existing drone footage to show the overall property, highlight specific areas to show their importance.

### 3D Modeling
- Finish Look about Lodge

### Other
- Final edits to Lake Erie Water Trail Map and Sign
- Update no mow areas
