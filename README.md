## Tom
### Facilities DB
- Sent info to Zoo staff to review for Fulcrum App considerations (i.e. review domain values for various categories): no feedback yet

### Legal
- All layers specific to Land Protection page have been loaded and styled on new page

### App
- Going to be reviewing format for trail segments used for routing by trails in the app

### ADA
- All ADA updates have been appended to the transition plan spreadsheet to track what's been completed to date. Now I'm working through populating a column that tracks what is left to do at each facility.

### Misc GIS
- Data migration to new server: noticed a lot of source data formats (for base layers) that have changed which makes updating more painful. I'm going to concentrate more on porting over whats currently in place and make incremental updates in between other initiatives.
