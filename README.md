# GIS Update

## Tom
### P&D
  - Walk/bike-shed analysis for 2021. Need to update park access points w/Sara on 12/22. Loading latest ACS data to database.

### Legal
  - Started Rocky River for integrating interior boundaries into GIS

### Updates
  - Switching geoserver data to reference the new database - IN PROGRESS

## App
  - Ongoing trail/network updates, need to push an update to production server for routing network (primarily to add West Creek mountain bike trail w/the loops builder)
  - Click-events built into MapBox not tested yet by Jeff
  - To do: re-examine Attraction icons and switch to match entries of Activities table from ITS. Attractions having a unique category is deprecated (which is a very good thing).

### PARK METRICS
  - Creating abbreviate spreadsheets to send to various departments for data collection (Finance/HR/Outdoor Experiences/Marketing)
  - Once requests are sent out to other departments, I'll input calcs from GIS (i.e. trail mileages, population estimate, etc)
  - Trail mileage summaries by Reservation requested by Marketing, started with Mill Stream Run which they needed right away. Rest after the new year.

### NR
  - Mapping out existing and proposed easements on NR server for Krynak and other NR staff to review. Also calculated impact to core area layer.
  - 2021 Deer Management mailings will be coming up in January

### Other Internal
  - Rangers requested mappoint data, gps coordinates and names of locations across park district.
  - Request from OE staff to map various features and related information in Bedford Reservation. Fulrcum form to be built once an account is set up for Jake.

### Outside request
  - Translating trails inventory into ODNR format: still on hold, waiting for details from ODNR.
  - Public request for USGS Topo maps, send a downloaded map of the area and some tips with how to acuire them from USGS's website
