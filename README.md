# GIS Update

## Tom
### P&D
  - Walk/bike-shed analysis for 2021: 2018 ACS and 2021 Parcel data loaded to database. Tinkering with disaggregating latest ACS demographics into the latest residential parcel data for use in the analysis.
  - Providing GIS support to Kelly/PROS for Strategic Plan work - ongoing

### Legal
  - Started Rocky River for integrating interior boundaries into GIS (on hold, no updates)
  - Last meeting determined a couple layer changes to Land Protection Server: add EJA, style project areas by project type (connection vs preservation) - incomplete
  - Set Nate up with Fulcrum, troubleshooting getting reservation boundaries updated in Fulcrum (old method is deprecated)

### Updates
  - Switching geoserver data to reference the new database - need to dig into NR, ADA, Historical Resources tabs (there's a lot of overlap between what's already completed from the main print server and land protection server pages)

## App
  - New Attraction categories have been integrated into mapbox icon sets, notably the grouped icon sets which aggregate multiple attractions at a single park site
  - Worked with Linsey on getting data for new attractions and filling in missing data from older attractions (i.e. GPS coordinates, IDs, Activities)
  - To do: push trails/network data update, switch to block icons at all map scales for Attractions

### PARK METRICS
  - 2019 data was completed for Park Metrics by the February deadline
  - Gold Medal Application data request has been compiled and input (2016 and 2020 numbers), only outstanding item is # of boat slips to be wrapped up asap
  - Trail mileage summaries by Reservation still need to be sent to Marketing, will close this out

### NR
  - Data requests for First Energy, awaiting to hear back about data format they can use (not shapefiles)
  - Need to organize a meeting with John, Pat and others to review the layers related to NR on the print server.
  - Request for historical aerials, this will be a longer-term project but for starters CPL has agreed to send high resolution scans (over 300 maps which will need to be georeferenced and stitched together)

### Outside request
  - Need to create a new Fulcrum account for Jake with Outdoor Experiences instead of waiting to pass him an open seat
