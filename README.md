## Tom
### P&D
- Facilities DB: Zoo assessments have started, light support needed to date - SAME
- Big Met: completed data collection at Big Met and generated a couple maps. Data collected created: pin curb alignment and counts, cart path centerlines, existing layouts for tee amenities for ADA consideration. Awaiting direction on what's needed for a bid book.
- Looking to reboot the walk/bike-shed analysis for 2021. First step: update park access points and downloaded the latest ACS data to import into database

### Legal
- 2020 Parcels are on Land Protection Server (LPS), going to push to all other pages before next meeting
- Need to load completed interior park boundaries data to LPS with some data joined from the REDB (Bradley Woods and Huntington complete, working on Rocky River now)

### App
- Ongoing trail/network updates, need to push an update to production server for routing network (primarily to add West Creek mountain bike trail w/the loops builder)
- Click-events built into MapBox not tested yet by Jeff
- To do: re-examine Attraction icons and switch to match entries of Activities table from ITS. Attractions having a unique category is deprecated (which is a very good thing).

### ADA
- ADA Transition Plan: added year info to corrective actions and awaiting next steps for publication/communication on website
- Compiled list of restrooms and graded the level of accessibility: Accessible, Mostly Accessible, Somewhat Accessible, Not Accessible. Awaiting final feedback from ADA Champions and will send a report to Greg.

### Marketing
- Pathfinder - updated (10/29): last call for feedback, looking good.

### Maps

- ITS: created set of Zoo wifi maps
- Trails: created a new set of NC trail maps for Ralph without labels
